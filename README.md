## Introduction to the project and tools used

As analysts of a real estate company, we were asked to answer some businessquestions using a dataset of almost 22.000 real estate sales in the Washington state, USA.

To answer the basic questions of the business, we imported the data into a SQL database using MySQL and the MySQL Workbench client.

Additionaly, the company wanted to explore some relationships within the data using visualisations to make these relationships easy to consume for the stakeholders and decisionmakers. We used Tableau to achieve this goal.

Finally, the company wanted to predict prices of real estate units with the given data. 
We achieved this by applying multiple linear regression algorithms after cleaning and wrangling the data with python in Jupyter Notebook.
After our first approach, we finetuned the model to increase the precision of our predictions.
